## ❓ Q&A Guide

### Factual Questions

**Q1:** What experience does Krishna have as a front-end developer?
**A:** Krishna has one year and ten months of experience as a front-end developer working with React and JavaScript.

**Q2:** Which library does Krishna use for CSS in his current project?
**A:** Krishna uses Tailwind CSS.

**Q3:** What is the current version of React Krishna is using in his project?
**A:** Krishna is using React version 17.

**Q4:** What features were introduced in React 19 according to Krishna?
**A:** React 19 introduced features such as concurrent rendering, server-side rendering, and new hooks.

### Conceptual Questions

**Q5:** What is the difference between section, article, and div tags in semantic HTML?
**A:** Section and article are semantic HTML tags used for SEO purposes, while div is a non-semantic tag used for bundling elements together. Semantic tags help in better structuring of the web page content.

**Q6:** Explain the concept of reflow and repaint in a browser.
**A:** Reflow is the process of recalculating the positions and sizes of elements in the browser. Repaint is the process of redrawing the elements on the screen, typically when styles like color change.

**Q7:** What are local storage, session storage, and cookies, and what are their differences?
**A:** Local storage can store data up to 5MB and persists even after closing the browser. Session storage also stores data up to 5MB but expires when the tab is closed. Cookies store small amounts of data which are sent to the server with each request and can have an expiration date.

**Q8:** What is the role of the event loop in JavaScript?
**A:** The event loop allows JavaScript to perform asynchronous tasks by handling events and executing code in a non-blocking manner. It ensures that the call stack is empty before executing tasks from the task queue, giving priority to microtasks over macrotasks.

### Analytical Questions

**Q9:** How would you handle state management in a React application, and what tools could you use?
**A:** State management in a React application can be handled using tools like Redux and Context API. Redux is a library that provides a centralized store for state management and uses actions and reducers to update the state. Context API is a React feature that allows passing data through the component tree without prop drilling.

**Q10:** What are the benefits and drawbacks of using functional components over class components in React?
**A:** Functional components are more readable and easier to maintain due to their simpler syntax and the use of hooks. They avoid the complexity of class components. However, class components have built-in lifecycle methods which can sometimes make handling certain scenarios more straightforward, although hooks like `useEffect` can achieve the same in functional components.

**Q11:** Describe how you would optimize the performance of a React application using lazy loading and code splitting.
**A:** Lazy loading and code splitting can optimize a React application's performance by breaking the application into smaller chunks that are loaded on demand. Lazy loading can delay the loading of non-critical components until they are needed, improving initial load time. Code splitting can be done using tools like Webpack to split the code into smaller bundles that can be dynamically loaded as required.

**Q12:** Explain how you would remove duplicate values from an array in JavaScript.
**A:** Duplicate values can be removed from an array using the `Set` object, which only stores unique values. For example, `const uniqueArray = [...new Set(array)]` will create a new array with duplicates removed. Alternatively, methods like `filter` can also be used to achieve this.




00:00 Hi Krishna, how are you?
00:01 >> Yeah, fine. Uh fine. Moit. Yeah, what
00:04 about you?
00:04 >> I'm also good. Thank you for joining on
00:06 time. Krishna.
00:08 >> Okay. Uh so Krishna in this interview uh
00:11 we can start with HTML CSS first then we
00:14 will move to the JavaScript and then
00:16 react part.
00:17 >> Yeah sure.
00:18 >> Uh so start with the introduction.
00:20 What's your uh current experience? How
00:22 much uh do you have any experience?
00:24 What's your education background? What
00:26 you do today?
00:27 >> Sure.
00:27 >> Like this please.
00:28 >> Oh okay. Yeah, currently I have one year
00:30 10 months of experience as a front end
00:34 working on react and javascript for
00:36 management redux I'm using. So I did my
00:39 beon computer applications uh through
00:40 college I placed uh so I joined
00:43 initially as a intern. So now I was a
00:46 junior developer junior front end
00:47 developer I trained as a front end and
00:49 react and in company itself. So they
00:51 trained on me. Yeah. Now working on a
00:53 project called aim project that is
00:55 e-commerce project. So client is eBay I
00:58 mean Kmart.
00:59 >> So yeah my roles and responsibilities
01:00 include like of integrating APIs and
01:05 building responsive
01:07 components so on. Yeah that is basic
01:09 introduction about me.
01:11 >> Any framework and library you are using
01:13 for CSS?
01:14 >> Tilewind. I mostly used Tailwind.
01:16 >> Okay. Tailwind. You have a knowledge in
01:18 Tailwind.
01:19 >> Yeah.
01:19 >> Okay. What about the simple CSS? Do you
01:21 have any knowledge like
01:23 >> Oh yeah, b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b
01:24 b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b
01:25 b b b basic knowledge and simple CSS for
01:27 interview purpose and I I have some
01:28 knowledge on CSS.
01:29 >> Yes, that's good. And uh which React
01:32 version you are using in current
01:34 project?
01:35 >> 17.
01:36 >> Okay, 17. You are in 17. And what what's
01:39 about the current version? Do you have
01:40 any knowledge?
01:41 >> Yeah, React 19. I think uh they
01:43 introduced coent rendering and server
01:46 side rendering some features and some
01:48 hooks has been introduced. I think React
01:50 19.
01:51 >> Yes, multiple multiple new are also
01:53 introduced in React 19.
01:54 >> Uh
01:56 >> okay, that's good. Uh so start with HTML
01:58 and CSS first. Uh yeah,
02:00 >> so uh the first question is what's the
02:02 difference between section, article and
02:04 div in cementing HTML?
02:06 >> Uh section and article are semantic
02:09 tags. Due is not a semantic tag. So it
02:12 is a block line block element.
02:14 The difference is like section section
02:16 and article used for SEO purpose mostly.
02:20 So while building the components
02:24 >> yeah and do is for like bundling the all
02:28 elements together.
02:30 So that is the basic difference between
02:32 them I think as
02:33 >> that's a trick that's a tricky question
02:35 actually I told section article and div
02:38 in semantic HTML you aware about div is
02:41 not in semantic HTML section and article
02:44 is semantic
02:45 >> HTML that's what I told div is not a
02:47 semantic element the section and article
02:49 and figure these are the semantic
02:51 elements these both are used for SEO
02:54 purpose
02:55 >> yes correct what are the uh reflow and
02:58 repaint in browser
03:02 refflow and repaint just just try try
03:05 out what is it uh it's a basic and basic
03:08 thing in browser whenever you use CSS
03:12 it's a basic thing refflow repaint
03:16 what about the meaning repaint just
03:18 think about it repaint means like
03:20 painting repaint
03:23 >> okay that what is fine but the that
03:26 definition I'm not getting like I'm
03:28 hearing that this question is first time
03:31 >> actually reflow means recalculate of
03:34 element position and size correct and
03:38 repaint meth means redraw of element uh
03:42 style like color okay okay
03:45 >> okay
03:46 >> that's uh thing okay can you share your
03:49 screen so I have one option based
03:52 question so I I want to ask
03:54 >> yes is it visible open any editor uh
03:57 like And okay, that's good. Okay. Uh I'm
04:01 asking. Okay. Just one second. I just
04:04 copy.
04:05 >> Yeah, sure.
04:06 >> Okay.
04:09 I'll paste it on chat. Can check the
04:11 chat.
04:18 What's the output?
04:20 >> If you want, you can copy it and paste
04:22 it on your editor.
04:29 Yeah. What's output are generally what
04:31 do you think?
04:34 >> Can you increase the size? Uh can you
04:36 increase the size of uh uh one more but
04:40 that's fine.
04:41 >> Yeah sure. Uh basically as per hierarchy
04:45 >> Mhm.
04:46 >> the ID is first priority.
04:50 >> Mhm.
04:51 >> Okay. As ID in the sense the option will
04:54 be red I think.
04:57 Why? Because of ID.
05:01 >> Yeah. As for hierarchy, ID is first
05:03 inline CSS, then ID, then class. Oh, I
05:06 think. Yeah, this is the hierarchy.
05:08 >> Yes. Uh, hierarchy is correct. Uh,
05:11 >> so output is final red.
05:13 >> Yeah, red. Red one. This one.
05:15 >> Yes, that's correct. That's correct.
05:17 >> Okay.
05:18 >> Okay. Uh, the next question is uh what
05:21 are the use of uh meta character set
05:24 use? You heard about it? HTML.
05:27 >> Yeah. Yeah. Meta text basically it will
05:29 contain
05:30 no meta metadata about the HTML
05:33 document. Example character test UTF8
05:36 character test uh and
05:39 document view port view port and all or
05:42 it will contain all these attributes and
05:45 elements.
05:46 >> What is what is it? UTF8
05:49 UTF it is a character set which defines
05:52 what we're writing the characters. So
05:54 that will define that character of 8 in
05:56 the sense that character I think that is
05:58 the definition I think. Yes
06:01 that that that encoding characters uh
06:03 that they they understand in the
06:05 characters uh whatever that we write in
06:08 English they
06:11 >> okay that is correct definition correct
06:12 >> yes that's defin
06:14 uh what's the difference between local
06:16 storage session storage and cookies
06:19 >> okay uh the three are web APS so it will
06:24 store in not cost stack it will store in
06:26 web APS see local storage is basically a
06:28 storage till 5 MB
06:31 >> 5 MB so it will uh it won't expire even
06:36 after closing the tabs for session uh
06:38 session storage will expire after
06:40 closing the tab itself and cookies will
06:44 uh send the uh some some data to uh as a
06:48 request to the h as a backend server I
06:52 think cookies
06:53 >> yeah this is the difference correct
06:55 right
06:56 >> yes correct uh so which one is more
06:58 secure. Any idea?
07:00 >> Oh, secure.
07:02 >> If if we if we use local storage, you
07:05 can just uh right click and inspect
07:07 something.
07:08 >> So, you can easily to check the local
07:10 storage things.
07:12 >> That's that is the term if it if you use
07:16 uh username and password in local
07:18 storage. So, anyone can get uh that
07:21 password to local storage.
07:23 >> Exactly. Exactly. That's what it's
07:25 better to use
07:26 >> session storage I think.
07:29 >> Uh cookies uh
07:30 >> cookies also I think. Yeah but yeah
07:33 cookies I think. Yeah yeah cookies is
07:34 better but I didn't use I used the
07:36 session and local. Oh I think
07:38 >> okay you use both uh in your e-commerce
07:41 project.
07:42 >> Yeah
07:43 as for senior developers used. Yeah.
07:46 >> Okay. They are they are asking to use
07:48 it.
07:49 >> Yeah. So any any difference uh which
07:51 type of condition you are use local
07:53 storage which condition you are using
07:55 self storage
07:57 >> conditions like set item and all right.
08:00 >> Mhm.
08:01 >> Yeah. For for password in for password
08:04 uh with the password login details and
08:06 authorization purpose also I used it
08:08 that one.
08:08 >> Okay. Got it.
08:09 >> Yeah.
08:10 >> Okay. Next question is why is Jed index?
08:13 What is Jed index and why is it used?
08:16 Oh J index
08:19 actually
08:21 so it it will work for position relative
08:26 and absolute absolute and static.
08:29 >> Mhm.
08:30 >> So it is used for
08:32 hide the some element from the UI.
08:37 >> Okay.
08:39 >> Yeah.
08:42 >> Okay. It's uh it's something like
08:44 overlay overlay between
08:46 >> overlay overlay. Yes. Yes. Exactly.
08:49 >> And what's the difference between flux
08:50 fox and grid?
08:53 >> Both are useful for layout design. Uh
08:55 that this is for single layout design
08:57 that is for multi-layer design. Yeah. Uh
08:59 the basically the flexbox will use for
09:02 single layout design. So it will display
09:04 the elements in cross-axis and main
09:06 axis. If you want to display the
09:08 elements in all across all sizes at
09:10 once, so we'll use grid grid layout. It
09:13 is multi-layer design.
09:16 >> Okay.
09:16 >> Yeah.
09:17 >> So, which one is single layer your which
09:19 one is 2D? We said 2D is the grid. 2D
09:23 single one is one layer design is this
09:25 one flex flex box. So, that is 2D design
09:28 grid
09:29 >> multilayer. Uh yeah, we can use multiple
09:32 elements. We can position the all
09:33 elements at once. But in display flex we
09:36 can you know we can align the elements
09:39 cross-axis or
09:42 x-axis and all but that one we can
09:45 access the all elements at once in
09:47 position some position.
09:49 >> Okay.
09:50 >> Yeah. Okay. Okay. That's fine. Uh for
09:53 HTML CSS we can move to the JavaScript
09:55 part.
09:56 >> Yeah.
09:57 >> Okay. What's the difference between let
09:59 where and cost?
10:00 >> Yeah. Let let const are introduced in
10:04 JSX feature where is basically a global
10:08 scope and in function it is function
10:10 scope. It is variable is hosted and
10:12 redeclared also and and reassignment
10:14 also allowed for latent cons also hosted
10:17 in not in
10:20 current but it will hosted in the
10:22 temporal dead zone. Temporal dead zone
10:24 inense it is a time between declaration
10:26 and the installation time. So that
10:28 that's why we'll get uh reference error
10:30 if we try to access the that variable
10:35 before the uh declaration we'll get
10:37 error reference error. So for hosting
10:40 this one where will we will give as a
10:42 undefined because it is completely
10:44 hosted and basically the variable
10:46 declarations are hosted not the
10:48 installations. Yeah, this is the uh
10:50 difference between three of them and let
10:52 we can reassign the value and reassign
10:56 the value redclare is not possible. Con
10:58 is completely immutable. So we can't
11:00 change and modify the value inside the
11:03 con. It is it's better to use const.
11:06 Yeah. In better to use con for project.
11:10 Yeah.
11:10 >> Okay. Uh you know where is the global
11:12 scope?
11:14 >> Yeah, it is where where is a global
11:16 scope in function? It is function scope.
11:18 Okay. So why is it global scope? My
11:21 question is
11:22 >> oh why in the sense like
11:26 >> any example uh what is global scope
11:29 means?
11:30 >> Uh global scope in the sense we can
11:32 access the values anywhere anywhere in
11:35 the code. So that is called global
11:37 scope. So for example we have where a
11:40 equal to 10 we can access that in
11:41 function inside function and outside the
11:43 function as well.
11:44 >> So that is called global scope. Yeah.
11:47 Okay, got it. Uh, what is event loop?
11:51 Uh,
11:51 >> event loop. Okay. Uh, event loop is a
11:54 specific feature
11:56 in JavaScript. So, it is used for
11:58 performing asynchronous tasks like
12:00 fetching APIs and all.
12:04 Uh, there are specific feature in event
12:06 loop.
12:08 First there is call stock. Call is it
12:10 will follow the principle called lost in
12:12 first out. the whichever we are writing
12:15 the code in IDE like code we are writing
12:18 in JavaScript so it will first store in
12:21 call stack so we are defining for we
12:23 declare the function first it will store
12:24 in call stack so then if there any set
12:28 timeouts and all and AP calls and all it
12:31 will show in web APIs so and there is a
12:34 task Q so two tasks micro task Q and
12:37 macro task Q so the priority is first m
12:41 macro sorry micro task Q That means the
12:43 promiser will execute first then it will
12:46 execute timers and all that means macro
12:48 task. So the web first it will store the
12:51 all web APIs in sorry all time set
12:54 timers and web APIs. It won't execute
12:56 the until the call stock is empty. If
12:58 the call stock is empty then it will
13:00 event loop will trigger the uh uh event
13:04 then it will it will get the all value
13:07 it will push the micro task Q2 and
13:09 micros Q2 and stock call stack. So then
13:12 it will perform the operation.
13:14 >> Any example in your mind?
13:16 >> So example in like for example we have a
13:19 function we have a function and we have
13:22 a timeout and set time out and
13:26 promises. So we have a resolve promise
13:28 of promise console lock promise. If you
13:31 want I can I will write the example.
13:33 Yes.
13:33 >> Yes. Yes please. That's
16:02 Yeah. Uh this is the example. See, even
16:05 though we called the function at the end
16:07 of the uh timeout and web APIs and uh
16:10 promises, but still it will execute the
16:13 first because
16:14 >> Yes.
16:15 >> Yeah. because of the uh order uh cost if
16:18 the function will go to call stock
16:20 first.
16:21 >> Mhm.
16:22 >> Yeah. Then uh it will uh then it will
16:26 check the set time then it will directly
16:28 go to
16:31 web API.
16:32 >> Okay.
16:33 >> Uh then then promise will go to directly
16:35 go to this m sorry micro task micro task
16:41 uh it will be first priority. It is
16:43 first priority.
16:46 first priority then yeah we are we are
16:50 resolving the promise here. So first
16:52 first execute the it will execute the
16:55 function then it will execute the
16:56 promise then it will execute the set
16:58 amount at the end. Yeah, this is the
17:00 example.
17:01 >> Yes, correct. Okay, I have some output
17:05 based question. So just give me I just
17:08 paste it to you.
17:10 Okay.
17:16 >> Okay. What's the output?
17:19 >> Oh,
17:21 first answer will be A.
17:23 >> Mhm.
17:24 >> Yeah. First it will uh console log the
17:26 A.
17:27 >> Mhm.
17:29 >> Uh then
17:32 it will execute D.
17:34 >> Mhm.
17:40 Then we will get C here. So
17:44 >> at the end the statement will execute
17:46 because of that hierarchy. First it will
17:48 go to call start then it will execute A
17:50 then it will go to web APIs. Then it it
17:52 will be there only until the time even
17:55 though this 0 seconds it will still wait
17:58 in the web API. So first it will resol
18:00 resolve this promise. I mean first it
18:02 will execute this promise. So then it
18:04 will move to web API. I mean from micro
18:07 to micro task.
18:09 >> Yes. Uh the output is correct.
18:12 >> Yeah.
18:12 >> Okay. Uh I have one more question to
18:14 you.
18:15 >> Okay.
18:20 What's the correct option? I just paste.
18:26 >> Yeah, sure.
18:29 >> What's the correct option?
18:31 >> Okay. Okay. Just a second.
18:35 Uh undefined. So we'll get because of uh
18:40 hosting. So we'll get undefined. Uh see
18:43 as I told this is global scope where is
18:45 the global scope latent const are
18:49 local scope. So that that those also
18:52 hosted but in temporal deone this this
18:55 will give undefined directly. So this is
18:56 hosted but initialized as undefined
18:59 only. If you access here means you will
19:01 get answer as five.
19:03 >> Yes. Uh yeah.
19:04 >> Okay. Okay. Yes. Correct.
19:07 >> Yeah.
19:08 >> Okay. One more question. I have uh
19:10 pasted on chat.
19:13 Can you check? Uh I have just uh shared
19:16 one more question too.
19:17 >> Yeah.
19:19 Okay. Okay.
19:22 >> Am I audible? Fine. Any noise?
19:25 >> No. No. No. Now fine. Now fine.
19:26 >> Yes. Yes.
19:29 What's the output?
19:32 >> Oh, we'll get here uh the three uh three
19:38 three times.
19:40 >> Why?
19:41 >> Oh, because uh where is global scope?
19:45 So,
19:47 >> while executing this loop, I mean while
19:49 iterating this loop, so it will
19:51 initialize as initially zero. So it will
19:54 initially zero then
19:57 >> this this set time out will take that
20:02 value. So the v where is hence because
20:05 of where I mean global scope it even
20:09 though this will until this the set time
20:11 will store in web.
20:13 >> Mhm.
20:14 >> There is a time because of 1 second. So
20:16 hence it will store in set time web a.
20:19 So until this uh the loop will uh that
20:22 time it will loop is three. So hence the
20:26 i take it as three. So then it will
20:29 execute three times because of this
20:31 where due to global scope.
20:34 >> Okay. When we have let
20:36 >> we'll get we'll get 0 1 2 3 we'll get
20:38 directly 0 1 2 3 we can check also we'll
20:41 get directly 0 1 2 3.
20:43 >> Mhm.
20:43 >> Mhm. And we have another option uh
20:46 without let also so with the let we'll
20:48 get uh so answer 012 012 with without
20:53 let without where with with the help of
20:55 where also we can execute 012 uh with
20:57 the help of closers.
20:59 >> Yes. Correct.
21:00 >> Yeah.
21:02 >> Yeah. Okay. One more question to you.
21:04 >> Yeah.
21:04 >> Just check
21:11 remove everything.
21:15 Okay.
21:18 Okay.
21:43 1 22 is in string or number.
21:46 >> So it will be string only because here
21:50 concatenation right it will be convert
21:52 this number into string. So we have
21:54 using one plus hence this is string.
21:57 >> Okay. Okay.
22:29 blue one.
22:38 Yeah, this also 112 due to string
22:42 version and
22:44 okay
22:46 basically uh this one I will explain
22:48 like see uh uh a will there is a asky
22:52 code for every character in code
22:55 language for yeah a is I think small
22:59 capital a is 64 this one 64 I think 64
23:04 >> of 64
23:07 I think minus minus will be string 64
23:10 minus b is 65 this number I am not sure
23:14 I don't know this is exactly correct or
23:16 not uh number
23:18 >> okay
23:21 >> 4 - 65
23:24 we'll get - one
23:28 + 2
23:32 uh minus
23:34 12 in string
23:37 >> you Mhm.
23:39 >> Uh this one I'm not sure but I think as
23:42 key value according it will connect
23:44 while comparing sorry while performing
23:47 arithmetic operations. So it will
23:49 convert that a to
23:52 >> that one I think a minus b. Okay. This
23:54 one
23:57 >> this one also
24:01 same. I think this one also
24:03 >> uh this one will be like place two and
24:06 this one say
24:12 >> okay okay okay you know okay now see
24:14 according to board rule first will sub
24:17 plus a place will be performed right
24:19 okay okay yeah B + 2 will be
24:26 B2
24:31 the
24:34 Oh
24:36 >> then B2 is a one thing. If we put a
24:40 minus B2 then that is not in number and
24:44 that is not in Bmass. It's not a number.
24:47 It's not a string.
24:48 >> Okay. We'll get n
24:52 >> okay.
24:53 >> Uh nn right. I think uh it's not a
24:56 number. This but then this is number.
25:01 Not not a number converted into
25:04 >> but two is string.
25:06 >> Oh empty empty string right?
25:09 >> Yes two is the string in this case
25:12 >> two is string but I mean what about
25:14 this? I think I heard about this one.
25:18 >> Okay no problem you can run it that is
25:22 much simple.
25:26 >> N because of k the last one is a minus
25:29 b. You are saying correctly
25:32 >> uh that is uh string to number is not a
25:34 number and the second last is uh two is
25:38 uh is a string that's why they they
25:40 paste it with n paste it with n2
25:44 is the string
25:45 >> okay
25:46 >> you know that's the reason
25:47 >> okay okay this will convert into n
25:49 initially right
25:50 >> yes not initially it's a d initially
25:55 converted to n a minus b and then 2 is
25:58 the n plus string two n2 and the second
26:03 one is plus operator first if we plus
26:06 operator first and b true if a minus b2
26:09 so it will consider as n
26:12 >> okay okay I mean uh I mean uh you mean
26:14 I'm not wrong right I mean ask value and
26:17 all
26:18 >> yeah that is ask value is not required
26:20 there
26:21 >> okay okay then everything is good and
26:24 other question is yours is 12 you said
26:27 12 uh for the Third one.
26:31 Third one means uh it will not 12
26:35 actually. U 1 + -1 is considered as a
26:39 zero.
26:41 >> Okay. 1 + - 1. Okay.
26:43 >> Mhm. Okay. No problem.
26:45 >> Uh I have one more question to you.
26:47 What's the output is there?
26:58 >> Oh. Oh, this is basically a closure I
27:02 think. Yeah, this is closure.
27:05 >> That is the concept of closer there.
27:08 There is use
27:09 >> uh I think this this function is a
27:11 closer itself because the this is parent
27:14 variable and this is the inner function.
27:17 Oh, wait. Answer will be
27:24 101.
27:31 Okay. Place
27:34 in here is zero.
27:37 >> Mhm.
27:40 one
27:49 zero then it will run this one.
27:52 >> Mhm.
27:55 >> Why zero? Uh my question is
27:58 >> oh because this is pre-increment. So in
28:02 uh
28:04 first it will after doing after
28:06 performing this uh operation then it
28:10 will uh still won't go to the uh next I
28:15 mean uh next number so it will be on the
28:18 uh zero itself because after calling the
28:21 uh
28:23 >> are you sure actually it's if it is
28:25 count + one count plus one then it will
28:28 be zero if plus count I I don't think it
28:32 will be.
28:34 >> Oh, think about it.
28:38 >> Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
28:44 >> Uh 1 2 3 then.
28:47 >> Yeah, that's correct. Can you run it?
28:49 Even I have some mistake. Let me check.
28:53 >> Yes, correct.
28:55 Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. One more
28:58 question to you. Uh just check it out.
29:07 What's the output?
29:12 >> I will save I will save this one
29:14 >> so that
29:17 no everything I will uh share it to you
29:19 after this interview.
29:22 >> Okay. Okay then fine.
29:28 >> This is the question right? Okay. Yes, I
29:31 want the output.
29:33 Um or the initially it will will get
29:36 start
29:38 then promise this is zero then
29:41 >> it will give end uh due to web ps
29:47 then it will go then it will resolve the
29:49 promise will get promise.
29:53 >> Mhm.
29:57 >> Then at the end it will give time out.
30:00 Yes, that concept is your correct is
30:03 clear. I know that's correct. Okay, next
30:07 question. The last version of JavaScript
30:09 is there. Okay.
30:19 Okay. This is spread operator. Okay.
30:23 Straight operator.
30:26 Um this will be
30:37 six. Oh, this is the answer for that
30:40 array. Then
30:42 this will be
30:46 okay. uh this will be like
30:52 um
30:54 we'll get like this I think hello in in
30:58 array format we'll get like this
31:01 >> yes uh that's correct
31:04 >> okay
31:05 >> okay uh theoretical part is uh can I ask
31:10 logical question also in JavaScript if
31:12 you are okay
31:13 >> yeah fine nothing
31:15 >> okay let me start uh the logical
31:17 question. Okay, we have uh you need to
31:20 remove the duplicate value from any
31:23 array. How do you do it?
31:26 >> Duplicate values. Yeah, I can I will
31:30 write the code is
31:31 >> yes I I need code how to remove the
31:34 duplicate value.
31:36 If you have any array like 1 22 33 3 4
31:41 >> Okay, wait. I'll just uh
31:57 So
31:58 >> yes, this is fine. Yeah,
31:59 >> that is fine.
32:06 >> How can you do it without for loop? uh
32:09 without for loop uh
32:13 a filter we can use filter also
32:16 >> okay
32:16 >> with the yeah we can use filter um
32:21 uh with the help of filter we'll check
32:22 the index yeah with with the help of
32:25 filter I think yeah that's that is
32:26 another method and with the help of for
32:28 loop and another method yeah that's it I
32:30 know I think two
32:31 >> you know set method set method
32:34 >> sorry
32:35 >> set method you know set method set
32:37 >> okay that is predefined I mean we don't
32:39 need to write code directly we'll get
32:41 we'll give
32:42 >> oh answer yeah
32:44 >> yeah that is I just want to ask you know
32:47 about it or not but you can continue
32:48 with for loop no problem
32:50 >> okay yeah new set this is the answer you
32:52 can
32:52 >> that is that is much simple
32:54 >> yeah simple most most of the interviews
32:57 they won't ask this one right that's why
32:58 I thought okay
32:59 >> actually the fresher level or one year
33:01 plus experience level generally they are
33:04 using this method
33:05 >> okay
33:06 >> that's why I'm thinking Okay. Okay.
33:29 >> Your house is near to airport. I think.
33:33 >> Yes. Bangalore HL airport.
33:35 >> Okay. You are near to Bangalore airport.
33:38 >> Oh, it's nearby only. That's why.
33:40 >> Yeah, that's the reason.
33:56 [Music]
34:12 [Music]
34:39 Yeah. Yes. Correct. Uh one more question
34:42 I have to you. Uh if you have any array
34:45 nested array like for example one two
34:48 then nested one two then nested one two
34:51 I want to flatten that array. Uh so how
34:54 do you do?
34:55 >> Yes sure.
35:06 First I will create a sample nested
35:09 array so that
35:11 >> okay
35:14 three time nested.
35:22 >> Oh this is fine.
35:23 >> Yeah that's good. That's good. I want to
35:25 flatten that area.
35:27 >> Okay. Uh there is two ways to flat the
35:29 array. One method is
35:31 >> going to use flat method.
35:33 >> Yeah. One is flat method. We can use a
35:35 predefined I mean we'll write direct
35:37 polyfield for flat directly. So with the
35:42 flat method we will direct flat method
35:43 we will just we'll flat the array
35:47 >> nor normal one it will contain like
35:51 numbers like for example there is
35:53 multiple flat uh inside multiple arrays.
35:56 So ne will give numbers in flat but we
35:59 can create a paul field for direct
36:02 flattening the array. So I will give
36:03 flat I will write
36:05 >> but oneplus experienced person they will
36:07 have a flat array knowledge that is also
36:10 okay and set method is also okay but no
36:14 problem.
36:15 >> Okay if you want I write that flat also
36:17 that is simple.
36:19 >> That is more that is more simple you can
36:21 continue whatever you are doing right
36:24 now.
36:24 >> Okay. Okay. Mhm.
36:26 >> Can I write this? Uh
36:27 >> yes, that is a function itself.
37:21 Is it okay?
37:29 Oh, okay.
38:16 We'll use recussion here like because uh
38:19 if if this is array so if it comes with
38:22 this element if this is array so we'll
38:24 you will again run the code from this
38:27 element in the new array. So that's why
38:29 I used recussion then
38:34 >> so if that is array so that we will use
38:36 recussion then if not array uh we'll
38:39 directly push the elements into new new
38:42 flatten array result.
38:43 >> Okay. Oh.
38:49 Oh, I can hear.
39:11 Sorry, we don't need to return here
39:13 because that is global. Then we'll
39:16 directly console lock.
39:27 So can I run the code?
39:28 >> Yes. Yes, you can.
39:32 >> I think it will. Okay. There is bug.
39:35 Okay.
39:46 It's okay.
39:47 >> I
39:55 Yeah.
39:57 >> Yeah. Fine.
39:59 >> Yeah. 1 2 3
40:01 >> 6 7.
40:03 Yeah, that's correct.
40:06 Okay. Let uh me move to the react part.
40:09 Do you have any uh uh knowledge of
40:12 nextjs also or it's uh react itself?
40:15 >> Oh no I don't have knowledge on nextjs
40:17 currently I'm planning to learn because
40:19 nowadays they are expecting nextjs. So
40:21 because of that server side rendering
40:23 and static site generation I think.
40:25 >> Yeah I'm planning to learn. Mhm. No
40:27 problem. You can um in next I think two
40:31 three after 2 month I will also start uh
40:33 next year series in my YouTube channel
40:35 itself. If you are checking
40:37 >> okay then then start that is fine right
40:39 even I am planning to learn so that I
40:41 will learn. So
40:42 >> okay start but in in my channel I have
40:44 doing in Hindi language. Are you able to
40:46 >> I can understand I will understand Hindi
40:48 but I can't speak but I will understand
40:50 Hindi.
40:51 >> Yeah no problem. I have already created
40:53 React Python. Yeah, I saw yeah I saw
40:56 Python and I even I'm planning to like
40:58 learn back end as well but currently no
41:01 there is no time. I'm planning to I mean
41:03 I'm currently preparing for interviews.
41:05 >> So
41:06 >> firstly firstly the React 20 is coming
41:09 in November you know React 20 version is
41:12 coming on next November. So I will start
41:15 the next react 20 react 20 in between
41:19 react 20 I will start next year itself
41:21 in the same series that much be more
41:24 valuable for others actually the next
41:26 that react 20 version is most uh
41:29 comfortable version even multiple
41:32 changes are there in react in react 20
41:34 that's why I am taking as a react 20 as
41:37 a
41:38 >> okay
41:38 >> series to combine with uh next year
41:41 combine with next year
41:43 >> and another thing From my end there is
41:45 suggestion if you want I will tell at
41:47 the end I because see
41:49 >> you can combine the all interview
41:50 questions and then make the video that
41:52 will be helpful to many people.
41:54 >> That is that is already I did I have
41:57 created three video uh no three uh
42:00 itself my itself video I have already
42:02 discussed itself my itself only I have
42:05 prepared 150 questions uh video in react
42:10 itself. I mean I mean JavaScript I mean
42:13 >> okay you are asking JavaScript output
42:15 based
42:15 >> output based question that's what I mean
42:17 >> uh that is also I planning to start a
42:19 DSA series you know DSA
42:21 >> DSA okay
42:22 >> DSA algorithm series so that will they
42:25 will cover everything for JavaScript
42:27 that is that is DSA series is just like
42:30 a Amazon and Google label questions I am
42:33 preparing there
42:34 >> okay that is like LinkedIn like LinkedIn
42:37 trees structure STS
42:41 graphs everything uh everything I will
42:43 cover over there. So that is more
42:45 advanced level series I am planning
42:48 >> that is undergoing but I don't have much
42:50 time so that's why things are doing this
42:54 but no problem uh I have long-term goal
42:58 within within this year within one year
43:00 I have created multiple series I know
43:03 100 plus language and everything. Okay,
43:05 that's great.
43:07 >> Actually, I'm a corporate trainer also.
43:08 That's because of trainer something.
43:11 >> Okay.
43:11 >> Boot camp, you know, boot camp student
43:14 when we hire in from college.
43:16 >> So, I have given the training
43:18 >> even some new language is coming in
43:21 India for example then only the my
43:24 responsibility to train everyone for
43:26 that language. So that's the reason I
43:28 have 100 plus language knowledge.
43:31 >> Okay.
43:32 >> Okay.
43:33 >> Great. No issue
43:34 >> nowadays that great
43:36 >> actually that that is the requirement
43:38 basis actually in my job I have a
43:41 technical lead as of now in uh SCL but
43:44 they move me to as a corporate trainer
43:47 they move me intensely because I know
43:50 multiple things so they are ask they are
43:52 think they are saying don't do code
43:55 train the train our students okay
43:57 >> even I am also doing uh like freelancing
44:00 for Infosys PCS Google
44:04 >> for training training
44:05 >> for training itself.
44:07 >> Okay. Okay. Internal training right?
44:08 >> Internal training in corporate in North
44:11 India itself not not in south one
44:15 >> but that's okay. Okay. Let me move to
44:17 the VJS part.
44:19 >> Uh what's the difference between class
44:21 and function component? Have you worked
44:23 class component firstly? That is
44:25 >> no I didn't even return this syntax as
44:28 well. So but so I have a difference for
44:30 interview purpose like I mostly used it
44:32 in functional component I started as
44:33 functional components. So I trained in
44:36 functional component itself directly
44:38 because one and a half year back only.
44:40 So I joined like as a fresher I joined
44:42 >> as a fresh you you done functional
44:45 component
44:45 >> directly. Yeah.
44:47 >> Okay. Yeah. Okay. What's the difference
44:48 then?
44:49 >> Uh difference is like uh functional
44:52 components we have a hooks in class
44:55 components we have like component did
44:57 mount and life cycle methods. compared
44:59 to class components the functional
45:01 components is more readable compared to
45:04 class because because of the complexity
45:06 of code. So the there is a less comp
45:09 less code in uh in functional components
45:12 due to hooks in that
45:15 uh function class components there are
45:18 we should write I mean multi lines
45:20 course and
45:21 >> another thing like
45:23 >> so you are saying uh the life cycle
45:26 method is not used in functional
45:27 component
45:29 >> uh instead of that life cycle methods uh
45:32 >> oh life cycle methods in the sense like
45:34 that mounting unmounting this
45:36 >> that is not That is not in use in
45:38 function component. Are you sure?
45:39 >> Yeah that that is we will use that that
45:41 is updating mounting in
45:43 >> that that word uh you are saying is that
45:45 word is not used the concept is using in
45:48 function component. How do you did
45:50 component mount in function component
45:52 then
45:54 >> in
45:55 with the help of updating state?
45:58 >> No uh within used effect you have all
46:01 three life cycle method you can use
46:02 within use effect. Are you know
46:06 >> okay actually there is three life cycle
46:09 method is there in class component what
46:11 is it
46:12 >> mounting unmounting
46:14 >> another thing is like
46:15 >> component did mount component did update
46:18 component and mount
46:19 >> unmount unmount yeah
46:20 >> okay all three are using in function
46:23 component are you know
46:25 >> yeah we are using with the help of hooks
46:27 actually I didn't I didn't have
46:29 knowledge on component mount and all
46:30 class components hence uh with within
46:34 use In fact if we give dependency array
46:36 blank what is it?
46:39 >> Oh blank dependency array if
46:41 >> so it will run only once I mean it will
46:43 render only once.
46:44 >> So if empty array it will run every time
46:47 with the with the dependency with the
46:49 help of dependency array. So it will run
46:52 only render whenever the state or props
46:54 has been changed that particular
46:56 >> if if we give any dependency array state
46:59 if we give state as a dependency array
47:01 what is it then?
47:03 state in a sense like a state while
47:05 updating the state right while while
47:07 updating state then only the use effect
47:09 is
47:10 >> will run will run
47:12 >> okay that is the called is component did
47:14 update that is the component did update
47:18 okay whenever you use uh return
47:21 >> okay
47:22 >> in the first dependency first uh
47:24 argument
47:25 >> within return within return whatever you
47:27 do what is it
47:30 >> uh I didn't
47:30 >> have you used written have you used
47:32 written inside use effect. Uh yeah
47:35 return a clean for cleanup functions we
47:37 will use right
47:38 >> yeah that is component did unmount
47:41 that is component
47:42 >> clean function okay
47:43 >> all three life cycle method in use use
47:45 effect itself
47:49 you just check after this interview you
47:51 just check in internet how do you uh
47:53 relate uh uh life cycle method in uh
47:57 functional component then you will get
47:58 more knowledge everything is used in
48:00 functional component nothing is uh uh
48:04 eliminate Nothing is terminate.
48:06 Everything is used in function
48:07 component. But function component gives
48:09 our work easy. That is the way we are
48:12 using function component itself.
48:13 >> And another thing readability also right
48:15 >> readability is is much uh new.
48:17 >> Yes. And updating state also there is
48:20 there is no hooks that it will I saw the
48:22 code while updating counter counter code
48:24 basic code that is I mean much complex
48:26 class component we can't understand
48:29 while seeing without knowing react we
48:30 can't understand.
48:31 >> Yes.
48:32 >> But functional we can directly
48:33 understand. Yes. Is the uh readable and
48:36 maintainable also?
48:37 >> Maintainable also. Yes.
48:38 >> Okay. Okay.
48:42 Okay. Uh the second uh Okay. The next
48:45 question is what's the difference
48:46 between
48:48 uncontrol and control component.
48:52 >> Okay. Uh control components in react is
48:55 basically control with the we'll control
48:57 the uh with the help of unchange method.
48:59 Like for example forms we'll we'll
49:01 control we first we'll declare the state
49:04 then we'll control the with the help of
49:05 unchange method that is called control
49:07 component uncont control components uh
49:10 is basically will access with the help
49:12 of user ref hook
49:15 >> dom and all dom elements and all will
49:18 directly access the will prevent from
49:21 unconditional
49:23 rendering and all with the help of use
49:24 that is called uncontrol components we
49:27 can't control with this help of state
49:28 directly you will control with the help
49:29 of use with current target and also yeah
49:34 >> you know DOM manipulation what is it
49:36 >> yeah do manipulation is like updating
49:38 the I mean uh rendering the all elements
49:42 into DOM so
49:45 that is uncontrol or control if we
49:48 manipulate the dome
49:51 DOM is controlled only like uh we'll
49:54 update the state so it will update in
49:55 DOM also right
49:57 >> Mhm. Yeah.
49:58 >> Are you sure
50:00 dome manipulation is uh happen use ref
50:04 or with the help of a state?
50:07 >> Usre sorry with the help of usrep. Okay.
50:10 Uh usere is used for to manipulate the
50:12 dom only. DOM itself. Yeah.
50:15 >> That's that's called an control
50:17 component.
50:17 >> Okay. Okay. Got it. Okay.
50:19 >> Uh okay. Have you used Redux?
50:21 >> Uh Redux I used it.
50:23 >> What's uh explain the Redux architecture
50:25 then?
50:27 actually I didn't even revision but okay
50:30 as much I know I will I will
50:32 >> no no no problem if you don't know uh
50:34 the confidence things uh so have you
50:38 used redux toolkit also
50:40 >> uh no no I didn't use it uh redux tool
50:43 just I use it
50:43 >> actually
50:45 redux toolkit is more advanced than
50:47 redux redux having most complex
50:50 >> codeact redux toolkit is most simplest
50:53 version of redux even React is also
50:56 recommended to use Redux toolkit it not
50:59 in Redux. Okay. What what about context
51:02 API? What is it?
51:03 >> Yeah, context API. It is it is basically
51:07 to
51:08 maintain the complex state management
51:12 like for you state we will use for local
51:15 component we will maintain the data
51:17 local component. We want to send the the
51:20 parent data to child and subchild. So
51:22 that will be messy like it will be
51:24 create prop drilling. It is called prop
51:26 dealing. To avoid proping we'll use
51:28 context API. So that means we we'll
51:31 create the state in one file. We'll use
51:33 the the code and data wherever we want
51:37 in child components on. So that will be
51:40 easy to you know use the wherever we
51:43 want the code I mean data. So then no
51:47 need to you know send pass the data from
51:49 parent to chain. We'll directly take the
51:51 data from parent then we'll pro uh we'll
51:54 uh I mean I will send it through the
51:57 provider then we'll uh get the data
51:59 through the use context to
52:01 >> okay
52:03 >> so it is a state management tool or no
52:07 >> it's not state uh it is for state
52:09 management only it is not tool I mean
52:11 redex is separate tool or it is library
52:14 sorry redux is library it is separate
52:16 yeah context API is includes the react
52:19 feature It is react feature. That's it.
52:21 Like that is also one feature. It's not
52:23 library and tool. It's included.
52:25 >> Yeah, it is react react feature.
52:27 Correct.
52:27 >> Yeah.
52:28 >> Okay. The my last question is what is
52:30 lazy loading and code splitting in
52:32 React?
52:33 >> Lazy loading and code splitting.
52:36 >> Yeah. Uh code splitting is basically
52:39 uh breaking the code into smaller
52:42 chunks. Then we'll utilize the code
52:43 wherever we want. That is called code
52:45 splitting. Uh with the help of code
52:47 splitting uh uh
52:54 will optimize the performance. So that
52:56 will be helpful in performance
52:57 optimization. And lazy loading is
53:00 basically uh uh we'll uh we'll lazy the
53:05 component until the uh this for example
53:08 we have a API fetching fetching the API
53:11 component in some custom hook there is
53:14 custom hook that is fetching the code
53:17 from another component. So while
53:19 importing that code in some parent
53:21 component so that we'll use the lazy
53:22 method so that until the core so we'll
53:26 show the user with the uh some code like
53:29 loading and all with the help of suspend
53:31 >> so so that then we'll after getting the
53:34 data from the API then we'll import that
53:36 code then we will show the exact UI for
53:38 example product while we will show
53:40 products on until then we'll show the
53:41 loading or processing or something
53:44 >> yeah that is called lasing code
53:46 difference both are for useful for per
53:47 performance performance optimization
53:48 only. So while I mean while fetching a
53:51 complete data instead of fetching the
53:53 data so we'll at least we'll will take
53:56 some time to show the user through some
53:58 know processing or uh waiting or
54:02 something. So then we'll we show the UI
54:05 so that will be easy to
54:08 see and performance optimation also.
54:09 Yeah.
54:10 >> Then how do you handle error error
54:12 boundaries?
54:14 uh error boundaries uh sign I think I
54:17 read about in class components I think
54:19 we don't have in this functional
54:20 components error boundaries uh errors
54:24 will handle
54:26 >> how you handle in your current project
54:29 >> errors with help of yeah as a we use try
54:31 catch method most currently mostly we
54:34 use that only I read about in error
54:36 boundaries that is used in class
54:38 components I think we can't use the
54:40 error boundaries in these functional
54:41 components I think Yeah, we have we have
54:44 lot of third party libraries are
54:46 available in functional component. We
54:48 can just uh insert it npm install error
54:51 boundaries like this. So you can easily
54:54 use that word in in term of error
54:56 boundaries that is more easy in
54:58 functional component.
55:00 >> Okay.
55:01 >> So lot of third party libraries are
55:03 there not an inbuilt feature in function
55:05 component but you can use third party
55:07 library.
55:08 >> Okay.
55:09 >> Okay. No problem. That is more advanced.
55:11 Uh I just asked
55:13 Uh no try catch is fine. Everyone knows
55:15 the tri catch.
55:16 >> It is easy way easy way to handle
55:18 errors.
55:19 >> Uh multiple errors that is okay.
55:21 >> Okay that's fine. Everything is good. Uh
55:24 according to uh you are doing good. The
55:27 knowledge is good. Just brush up some
55:29 advanced things. Just learn something
55:31 back end things. Just learn advanc
55:33 reactux
55:35 toolkit.





## ❓ Q&A Guide

### Factual Questions

**Q1:** What is the primary specialization of Alam Pasha?
**A:** Alam Pasha primarily specializes in JavaScript and React.

**Q2:** What are some of the key responsibilities in Alam's recent role?
**A:** Alam's key responsibilities include building UI components, styling them using React libraries, API integration, and deployments using CI/CD pipelines.

**Q3:** What is the difference between local storage and session storage?
**A:** Local storage persists data until explicitly deleted and is shared across different tabs within the same domain, whereas session storage only retains data for the duration of the page session and is cleared when the tab is closed.

**Q4:** What are semantic tags in HTML? Give three examples.
**A:** Semantic tags clearly describe the meaning of the content inside them, improving SEO and accessibility. Examples include `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<header>`.

### Conceptual Questions

**Q5:** What is event delegation in JavaScript?
**A:** Event delegation is a technique where a single event listener is added to a parent element to manage events for multiple child elements through event propagation and bubbling up the DOM tree.

**Q6:** Explain the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const` in JavaScript.
**A:** `var` is function-scoped and can be redeclared and reassigned. `let` and `const` are block-scoped; `let` can be reassigned but not redeclared, while `const` cannot be reassigned or redeclared.

**Q7:** What is the purpose of React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`?
**A:** `useState` is used for managing state in functional components, while `useEffect` is used for running side effects such as data fetching and DOM manipulation.

**Q8:** What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components in React?
**A:** Controlled components have their form data managed by React state, while uncontrolled components manage their form data directly through the DOM.

### Analytical Questions

**Q9:** How would you explain the concept of closure in JavaScript with an example?
**A:** A closure occurs when an inner function has access to variables from an outer function even after the outer function has finished executing. For example:
  ```javascript
  function outerFunction() {
    let outerVariable = 'I am outside!';
    function innerFunction() {
      console.log(outerVariable);
    }
    return innerFunction;
  }
  const closure = outerFunction();
  closure(); // Logs: 'I am outside!'
  ```

**Q10:** How does the event loop work in JavaScript?
**A:** The event loop manages asynchronous operations in JavaScript's single-threaded environment. It moves tasks from the task queue and microtask queue to the call stack for execution, ensuring non-blocking behavior.

**Q11:** Why might you choose Redux over Context API for state management in React?
**A:** Redux is preferred for larger, more complex applications because it provides a more structured approach to state management with actions, reducers, and a centralized store, whereas Context API is more suitable for simpler state sharing.

**Q12:** How can you optimize the performance of a React application that handles a large amount of data?
**A:** Performance can be optimized through techniques like pagination, infinite scrolling, and virtualization using libraries like `react-window` or `react-virtualized`.

These questions provide a comprehensive assessment of Alam Pasha's technical skills and conceptual understanding, progressing from basic factual knowledge to more complex analytical thinking.



00:00 Hi Alam, how are you?
00:01 >> Hi. Hi m I'm good. How are you?
00:04 >> I'm also good. Thank you. Thank you Alam
00:05 for joining on time. So firstly
00:08 introduce about yourself, your education
00:09 background and all.
00:11 >> Okay. So my name is Alam Pasha. Uh
00:14 >> I'm I have completed my Btech from MJ
00:17 College of Engineering. I'm a front- end
00:20 developer with three years of
00:21 experience.
00:22 >> Mainly specializing in JavaScript and
00:24 React. Okay. And uh I have a strong
00:26 background in building and managing
00:28 front- end applications optimizing them
00:31 and u uh in my recent role I have
00:34 contributed as a front-end developer uh
00:37 working closely with uh different
00:39 crossunctional teams and uh building
00:42 scalable and high performance
00:43 applications which are aligned with the
00:45 business requirements. My work involves
00:48 building UI components uh styling them
00:51 and uh building them using React
00:53 libraries. also do API integration and I
00:56 also do uh deployments using CI/CD
00:59 pipelines and u this is about my work
01:03 and then uh I like about my achievements
01:06 I have been uh recognized as a key
01:08 contributor for three consecutive years
01:10 and then I have been awarded as a
01:13 problem solver badge from the technical
01:15 architect of my project. These are about
01:18 my achievements and the hobbies. I like
01:20 to like uh play outdoor games and like
01:24 music or some YouTube vlogs or videos.
01:27 These are like my hobbies.
01:28 >> Okay.
01:30 >> Okay. Good. So, which kind of domain you
01:32 are worked any specific domain or
01:36 something else?
01:37 >> Uh yeah, I have worked completely on
01:39 react during my experience at my current
01:42 organization. domain means like uh
01:44 banking domain or any e-commerce domain
01:46 something enterprise applications.
01:49 >> Okay. You are in enterprise.
01:52 >> Okay. And you have three year
01:53 experience. All are in react.
01:56 >> Yeah. All are in react.
01:58 >> Okay. So
01:59 >> first couple of months were like
02:00 training and then my work actually
02:02 started after.
02:03 >> So so have you worked class component or
02:06 you started your career in function
02:08 itself?
02:09 >> No no function only.
02:11 >> Function only. Okay. In three years
02:14 before the function component is most
02:16 >> usable.
02:18 >> Okay. Uh so we can start with HTML CSS
02:21 first then we will move to JavaScript uh
02:24 and then React. Okay. So what's the
02:28 difference between HTML and HTML 5?
02:31 and HTML 5 like HTML 5 we have more uh
02:36 improved uh tags and then
02:41 for HTML 5 more meta data can be
02:44 integrated in that so that is the basic
02:47 difference I don't know much about the
02:49 difference
02:50 >> no problem we using
02:52 >> actually HTML 5 is the more SEO friendly
02:57 in term of semantic tag they are using
03:00 So the my next uh question is what is
03:02 semantic tags? Give me some three
03:04 example.
03:06 >> Okay. Semantic tags are the tags which
03:08 clearly describe the meaning of the
03:10 content inside them. For example, we
03:13 have section, article. Then we have
03:15 header, footer, nav.
03:17 >> And these tags improve SEO and
03:20 accessibility. They make the code more
03:22 maintainable and readable.
03:24 >> Yes, correct. Okay. Uh what's the
03:27 difference between inline inline block
03:30 and block element in HTML?
03:33 >> Okay. Okay. So these elements uh block
03:35 element it takes the full width and it
03:38 starts on a new line. Whereas inline it
03:40 only takes uh the width which is
03:43 required which is necessary for it and
03:45 it doesn't start on a new line. Inline
03:47 block it behaves like a inline but I
03:50 think the height and width can be
03:52 adjusted here for inline block.
03:55 >> Okay. This is the basic difference.
03:56 >> What are what about block
04:00 >> block is the it starts on a new line. It
04:02 takes the full width uh of that uh uh
04:06 container. And suppose we have example
04:08 like a div tag. It is a block element.
04:11 It starts on a new line.
04:13 >> Okay.
04:13 >> For uh this inline we have a span tag.
04:17 >> Okay. uh what's the difference between
04:20 emm
04:21 pixel and percentage in CSS units?
04:26 >> Okay,
04:26 >> so pixel is like fixed size. Suppose we
04:29 give a size of 10 pixel, it is fixed
04:32 across uh em it is like relative to its
04:36 parents font size and then we have it is
04:40 relative to the roots uh font size.
04:43 percentage is like it is relative to the
04:46 parents element size actually.
04:49 >> Okay.
04:51 Okay. So, okay, that's good. And what's
04:54 the difference between local storage and
04:56 session storage and cookies?
04:59 >> Okay. local storage uh uh these all
05:02 three are like browser web storage
05:04 mechanism and in local storage uh all
05:07 three like in local storage we store a
05:09 string and it stays until we explicitly
05:12 delete it. we need to go manually and
05:14 then delete this. And it is uh whatever
05:17 we store the data in local storage, it
05:19 is shared across uh uh different tabs if
05:22 they are using the same domain. Whereas
05:24 session storage, it stays this data
05:26 stays uh only until we have the live
05:29 session. If the session or the tab is
05:31 closed, this data is get clear. It
05:34 clears automatically. Whereas cookie is
05:36 like we can store small set of data
05:38 which can we can send this over every
05:41 HTTP request automatically we can it
05:44 sends
05:45 >> uh as you said all three are in browser
05:48 related things.
05:50 >> So
05:51 >> so which uh uh are you sure cookies is
05:53 on browser related thing or they can
05:57 managing client itself all three
05:59 >> from server? No no from server uh we can
06:02 send the cookies as well.
06:04 >> Okay. local storage and session storage
06:05 or web stoages.
06:07 >> Okay. So, which one is good if we build
06:10 a secure uh website like banking domain?
06:15 >> Uh-huh. So, it depends. So, like uh if
06:18 we want to store a user preference or a
06:21 theme maybe dark mode or light mode, we
06:23 can use the local storage. Session
06:25 storage we can like store use to store
06:29 some temporary data like form data or
06:31 something like that. uh cookies we can
06:33 store to use to store this tokens.
06:37 >> Is it good habit to
06:38 >> tokens?
06:39 >> Uh is it good? Uh we can do all three in
06:43 same project. We can use all three in
06:46 same project. Is it good practice?
06:49 Um
06:52 I'm not sure whether it is a good
06:53 practice but uh it depends on our
06:56 requirements because for simple uh theme
07:00 team storage we can just use local
07:02 storage. We don't need to store this in
07:04 session or or the cookies or local
07:08 storage is best for storing the theme.
07:11 >> Okay. Okay. Good. Uh for example like
07:16 >> Okay. Okay. Okay. Go ahead.
07:18 >> Okay. For example, you have any image
07:21 any image
07:22 >> uh if you want to it converted as a
07:25 responsive image which CSS you usually
07:29 use
07:31 for that we can have this max property
07:35 max and then height we can give a give
07:39 it in percentage or maybe auto set we
07:42 can set it as auto then image will be
07:44 responsive quite responsive
07:47 Okay, that's a that's a good uh but any
07:50 other way uh
07:53 like any predefined method in CSS
07:57 >> we can use media queries
08:00 >> or object fit contain we can use to
08:03 clearly display the images and media
08:06 queries as well.
08:07 >> Okay. So what's the difference between
08:09 CSS grid and flex box?
08:13 >> Okay, CSS these both are used to style
08:15 the layouts. Uh whereas flexbox is like
08:18 a one-dimensional layout either rows or
08:20 columns. U main properties in flex are
08:23 like display flex justify content flex
08:26 direction align items. Flex can be used
08:29 to like uh if we want to style an uh
08:32 layout of of navigation bar where we
08:35 have different elements we can style
08:37 them horizontally or vertically. And
08:39 then for grid uh it is a two-dimensional
08:42 layout. We can move rows and columns
08:44 both. And then we can use this grid for
08:46 the complete layout of the uh web page.
08:50 Or else we can uh have a container and
08:53 uh suppose we are having a cards layout
08:55 that we can have a container and use
08:57 this grid property.
08:59 >> Both are uh used for responsive design.
09:02 >> Okay. Can you share your screen? I need
09:05 to share one code. I want output of
09:08 that. Entire screen Chrome tab
09:13 used to Google Meet Teams.
09:15 >> Yes. Yes.
09:17 >> Able to click on Yeah.
09:21 >> Is it visible?
09:22 >> Yes, it is visible. Okay. Open any
09:25 editor. Uh like uh one compiler is good
09:29 according to
09:32 uh one compiler
09:33 >> one compiler is uh able to do in HTML,
09:36 CSS and everything.
09:40 Open it and close it. That small thing.
09:44 Cross it. That is small window that is
09:46 open. Yes. Okay. Open JavaScript or
09:51 somewhere you can open JavaScript. No
09:52 problem.
09:54 >> Okay. Let me
09:57 paste copy paste that code to you in
10:00 chat box. Uh okay. I have shared one
10:03 code to you. anyone.
10:14 >> Yeah.
10:15 >> Okay. Uh so I want to uh can you
10:17 increase the font of your screen? Screen
10:19 font is very small.
10:22 More some more.
10:24 >> One more. One more. Yeah, that's fine.
10:27 Okay. Uh what's the output?
10:31 >> Okay. We have a simple HTML and body
10:36 print
10:38 world w
10:40 >> okay it's uh this paragraph replace with
10:45 word are you saying what about the hello
10:49 >> no no no no no this paragraph won't
10:52 replace inside the paragraph it will
10:54 print H1 world
10:56 >> okay you said key hello and world both
10:59 are print
11:01 >> yeah Hello and world along with this uh
11:04 angular braces.
11:05 >> World is uh capital uh H1. H1 is also
11:10 printed. You said
11:12 >> no.
11:14 >> No actually the world is print in H1 tag
11:18 itself. Not H1 tag specific H1 tag is
11:21 print. Is it inner HTML is
11:25 okay no problem. One more question I
11:28 have to you.
11:30 Okay.
11:40 If you change that uh JavaScript to HTML
11:43 then it's you can run that code also. Uh
11:46 can you
11:48 that JavaScript to HTML
11:53 search search HTML? Yeah, that one. And
11:58 then uh paste uh my first code.
12:02 My first code. Not that one. Not that
12:05 one. First code. Then you can check uh
12:07 the Okay.
12:11 The world is uh doing it. Okay. And now
12:15 the second question. What's the output?
12:20 Is it very simple?
12:28 Mhm.
12:30 What is it?
12:31 >> A check box. Check box. It will render a
12:33 checkbox which is disabled.
12:35 >> Okay. Yes. Correct. That is very very
12:37 simple.
12:39 >> Okay. And one more question I have.
12:43 Yeah. This way.
13:06 I'm not sure on this.
13:11 >> Have you used all error?
13:15 Um I have not uh used much.
13:18 >> Okay, no problem. Then last question for
13:22 you or HTML thing.
13:29 Not that uh the blow. Yes.
13:45 So text over me and when we hover over
13:50 it, it will display tool tip.
13:52 >> Yes. But it is not working in this
13:54 browser. But don't run it. But your
13:56 answer is correct.
13:59 >> Okay. Okay.
13:59 >> Uh okay. Uh let me move to the other
14:03 one. Uh JavaScript part. So what's the
14:08 difference between the small uh okay uh
14:12 let me start with the JavaScript part.
14:15 Uh start with the basic one. What's the
14:17 difference between that where and cost?
14:22 >> Const. Yeah. So all these three are used
14:25 to declare variables. Uh whereas v is
14:28 function scope latin const are block
14:31 scope. Mhm.
14:32 >> Uh and v can be redeclared in the same
14:35 scope whereas let and const cannot be
14:37 redeclared.
14:38 V can be v and let can be reassigned.
14:41 Const cannot be reassigned. Uh v is
14:43 hoisted and it is initialized with
14:46 undefined. Whereas let and con are also
14:48 hoisted but uh they are not initialized
14:51 with undefined. They are in temporal
14:53 dead zone. So accessing them before
14:55 initialization will give you a reference
14:58 error.
14:59 >> Okay that's correct. Okay. So, so which
15:03 one is uh mostly you are using that or
15:07 cost?
15:10 The which scenario uh
15:13 basically I want to know which scenario
15:15 you are mostly used let which scenario
15:17 you are mostly use const
15:20 [Music]
15:24 variable which we want to reassign. I'll
15:26 use let uh for const I will use for
15:29 declaring functions or objects where we
15:32 can u uh like change the values of the
15:36 object uh even if it is declared with
15:38 con
15:39 >> why where is not able to use mostly as
15:42 of now any drawback specific drawback
15:46 >> yeah yeah because it is function scoped
15:48 uh it is very difficult to manage
15:50 variables declared with v and after e6
15:54 we have let con so We use the Latin con.
15:56 >> No, management is very good. War is very
15:59 good in term of management. I know I
16:02 want to know basic uh why we are not in
16:06 use.
16:08 Have you worked uh have you know global
16:10 scope something?
16:12 >> Yeah.
16:13 >> If you initialize something in where it
16:16 will be uh it will be stored in browser
16:20 global object. It will look like as a
16:22 browser global object that can be stored
16:25 permanently in browser itself. So it
16:28 will give you that uh something that
16:31 where is you can use anywhere in your
16:33 component that as you said it's a
16:34 functional scope. That's the reason
16:37 where is uh not able to use mostly it
16:40 will be stored internally in browser and
16:43 that lat and cost is not initially
16:46 stored within the dome itself.
16:48 >> Okay.
16:49 >> Okay. What about hosting in JavaScript?
16:54 >> Yeah, hosting is like JavaScript's
16:56 behavior of moving uh variables and
16:58 function function declarations to the
17:00 top of their scope during the creation
17:03 phase of the execution context.
17:06 >> Can you give me some example to share
17:09 your screen to how the hosting is work?
17:21 screen visible.
17:22 >> Yeah.
17:35 We have a
17:38 [Music]
17:40 need to add
17:42 a value to. So when we try to
17:47 console.log before it is initialized.
17:51 Mhm.
17:53 We will get the value of a as undefined.
17:59 Whereas if we declare this variable
18:01 using let it is hosted
18:06 and it will like
18:09 give you a reference since it is in
18:11 temporal d.
18:12 until the execution comes to this line
18:15 the variable is not initialized using
18:17 let so this will throw a refu
18:20 >> okay what is event delegation
18:24 >> event delegation uh is like a technique
18:27 which we use to capture the events by
18:29 attaching the event listener to the
18:31 parent component suppose we have
18:33 multiple child elements when we click on
18:35 any child uh the event propagation
18:38 happens and the event is bubbled up the
18:40 DOM tree Using event delegation we
18:44 attach this event listener to the parent
18:46 component and capture this uh event.
18:49 >> Okay. Give me any example in your mind
18:52 if you have.
18:55 >> Yeah. Suppose we have a div uh component
18:57 and a a group of buttons maybe couple of
19:01 buttons and clicking on any button we
19:04 can attach an event listener on the
19:06 parent div and then catch this event uh
19:09 using the identifier. Okay.
19:12 Okay. What are promises and asyncate?
19:16 What's the difference?
19:17 >> Yeah. Okay. Uh promises is like an
19:21 object which uh represents the eventual
19:23 completion of an asynchronous operation.
19:26 It has uh three states mainly pending,
19:30 fulfilled and rejected. Whereas async
19:32 away it is uh just the syntactic sugar
19:36 over promises. Behind the scenes it uses
19:38 uh async this promises only. But uh this
19:42 async aait uh by looking at async aait
19:45 code if code is written in async aait it
19:47 looks like a synchronous code but behind
19:49 the scenes it uses these processes only.
19:53 >> Okay. So if we have multiple API
19:57 can we can we use same uh in sync away
20:00 itself or we have some different method
20:03 in promises.
20:05 In promises uh we can chain them and
20:08 also we have this uh promise methods
20:11 promise.all promise dot raise promise
20:14 dot any these methods you can use.
20:17 >> Okay. Okay. What are closure and
20:22 how it is used?
20:25 Mhm. So closure in JavaScript uh is like
20:28 uh it occurs when the inner function can
20:31 access and remember variables from the
20:33 outer function even after that function
20:35 has finished execution. So this is used
20:39 to the closures can be used for data
20:41 privacy as well as uh maintain the
20:44 state.
20:45 >> Okay.
20:46 >> This is a closure.
20:48 >> Okay. What's the difference between
20:50 debouncing and throttling?
20:55 These are uh debounce throttling are
20:58 techniques like uh for optimization. Uh
21:01 debounce is like it triggers the
21:04 function only after uh user stops for
21:07 certain uh seconds a specified time
21:10 interval. Whereas throttle it uh
21:12 triggers the function after every uh
21:16 specified time interval. Suppose we give
21:18 1,000 milliseconds, it will trigger the
21:20 function only after 1 second. Even if
21:24 the
21:25 uh user is doing events, user is doing
21:28 activity between the time frame, it will
21:30 not trigger the function. It will only
21:32 trigger the function after that uh uh
21:35 timer after that uh specified time
21:38 interval.
21:41 >> Yeah. Okay. Okay. You said event uh so I
21:44 want to know how event do when call back
21:47 uh call back stack is working.
21:50 >> Call stack. Call stack. how event loop
21:53 and call stack are working in
21:54 JavaScript.
21:56 >> Okay. Okay. So this is the mechanism.
21:59 Event loop is like a mechanism by which
22:02 JavaScript handles uh asynchronous
22:04 operations in a single threaded
22:06 environment. Since JavaScript is a
22:08 single trigger.
22:09 >> So what happens is we have a call stack.
22:12 Uh we have a event loop. Suppose we have
22:15 a piece of code uh where I can write
22:18 some code. Mhm. Suppose we have r a = 10
22:24 something like this.
22:25 >> Mhm.
22:26 >> And then we have a we'll just uh console
22:29 log this.
22:31 >> Mhm.
22:34 [Music]
22:40 >> We have a timeout.
22:42 >> Mhm.
22:44 And this function just simply
22:48 console blocks
22:55 string suppose time
23:00 don't need a variable actually suppose
23:02 in this we have a string.
23:05 So when the u
23:08 execution uh starts uh the execution
23:11 context uh gets created
23:14 >> and then uh this code is pushed to the
23:16 call stack.
23:18 >> Okay.
23:19 >> So uh when we push this code to call
23:22 stack uh this uh first uh during the
23:25 execution phase first line of code the
23:27 code executes line by line. This first
23:30 line is executed and this is printed and
23:33 then it is popped out of the call stack.
23:35 Then we come for the time set timeout.
23:38 This is set timeout cannot be handled by
23:40 the call stack. It is sent to the
23:43 browser. Actually the web APIs handle
23:45 this. There the timer starts and then it
23:47 returns this call back into a task Q and
23:51 instead of timeout if we have a promise
23:54 then it returns this call back to the
23:56 microtask Q. And this microtask Q has
23:59 priority over the task Q. Uh the event
24:02 loop is like it's it's like a traffic uh
24:05 controller whose job is to pick the
24:07 items in the microtask Q and task Q.
24:09 First it will check it will check for
24:11 the microtask Q. It will pick up the
24:13 items and send it to call stack for
24:14 execution. When the micro task Q is
24:18 empty then only it will go for task Q
24:20 which is the call stack uh sorry uh call
24:23 back Q. uh it will pick the items from
24:25 there and then it will send it to the
24:26 call stack and u it will execute those
24:29 things.
24:30 >> Okay. So task Q and call stack are uh
24:35 different.
24:37 >> Uh task Q and call stack are different.
24:41 >> Yeah. Yeah. It is different. It is
24:42 different. Since web API handles this
24:46 timer events and promise events
24:47 asynchronous operations, it cannot
24:49 directly send it to the call stack. uh
24:52 it will send this uh call backs to the
24:55 uh call back Q which is the task Q and
24:57 the micro task Q event loop will event
25:00 loop will pick up this items and send it
25:02 to the call stack for execution. If in
25:04 case event loop is uh blank only having
25:08 one function uh it's asyn function. So
25:12 still having all the flow are doing or
25:15 it is easily capture event loop itself
25:19 in a task itself.
25:23 So process are same for every
25:25 asynchronous function
25:27 >> only if we have asynchronous operation
25:30 >> uh in the call stack it call stack won't
25:33 be able to execute this it will send it
25:35 to the this uh browser and then it comes
25:39 back to the call back cube from there
25:41 event loop picks up and then it sends it
25:43 sends it to the call stag this is the
25:46 reason uh this timers whatever we have
25:48 in JavaScript are not accurate exactly
25:51 >> because if we have some code running in
25:52 the call stack it will wait for them to
25:55 complete and then send this events.
25:58 >> Okay. You said browser if we have NodeJS
26:02 NodeJS doesn't have any browser.
26:04 >> So what do you think how how it is
26:07 sended
26:08 >> in that case?
26:12 Uh in that case
26:15 um unfortunately we will not be able to
26:18 run this in the NodeJS whatever browser
26:21 functions we have it will point to the
26:25 window object since NodeJS is a runtime
26:27 environment we won't be able to run this
26:30 functions
26:31 >> actually NodeJS having a global
26:33 environment itself so they can handle it
26:37 >> okay
26:38 >> okay no problem that is out of scope in
26:41 this interview. What is the uh uh
26:44 difference between shallow copy and deep
26:45 copy?
26:46 >> Copy and deep copy. They are used to
26:48 copy the objects. Uh
26:51 when we do a shallow copy, it copies the
26:54 top level level elements only. Suppose
26:57 we have a nested structure in an object.
26:59 An object it contains another object
27:02 then it only copies the references of
27:05 those nested structure. So any change
27:07 made in the shallow copy it will also
27:10 reflect in the original object. But
27:13 whereas in deep copy it is uh it clones
27:16 the whole object. It uh doesn't like
27:20 does it like a shallow copy. It clones
27:22 the whole object and even if there are
27:25 nested objects everything is copied. Uh
27:28 shallow copy can be done using this uh
27:30 uh rest operator object do assign. Deep
27:33 copy we can use JSON.parse pass in JSON
27:36 dot string fine and pass in the answer.
27:38 >> What about the spread operator? Spread
27:40 operator is used which one deep copy or
27:43 shallow copy operate it is in the
27:46 shallow copy.
27:48 >> Okay. Okay. Got it. Uh okay. Let me ask
27:52 uh some
27:56 output B for cell. So just give me one
27:58 second. I'll just copy it and paste to
28:00 you.
28:02 Okay.
28:06 Okay.
28:08 What's the output of this?
28:25 1 + 2 + 2. This is I think string
28:30 concatenation. photo just to the output.
28:36 This one
28:41 this one
28:43 the same thing
28:48 about uh not sure about the third one. I
28:53 think it will print according to the
28:55 precedence.
28:57 >> Okay, first one is correct. Second one
29:00 is double plus. Double plus is
29:03 calculated as a plus itself. They
29:06 convert second string to the number.
29:08 Then 32. And the third one is 02. Okay.
29:13 The third one is 02 because the plus
29:15 minus is also converted as a minus. So 1
29:18 - 1 is zero and then to itself.
29:23 >> Yeah, that is you can run it if you
29:25 want. If you run button is there.
29:29 Okay, it's there. Okay, let me ask one
29:34 more question to you.
29:45 What is it? What's the output?
30:02 =
30:07 row I guess and
30:12 this will also print
30:17 this one
30:22 this will print false.
30:24 Okay, first one is true is correct.
30:27 Second one is false because both the
30:29 object having different different
30:32 reference error
30:34 and uh
30:34 >> okay their references will be different.
30:36 So yeah so it will print false.
30:40 >> Yes. And the third one is uh true.
30:46 >> Oh
30:46 >> yes. Okay. Uh
30:50 >> conversion.
30:51 >> Yes. Type.
30:53 Okay. Uh one more question I have.
30:59 Okay.
31:03 What's the output of this sensor log?
31:22 and use for b =
31:26 x = 2.
31:29 So this one will connect.
31:34 >> Yes, that is very simple. Correct. Uh
31:37 one more I have saved to you. Just check
31:40 it out.
31:44 We have a set time mode just
31:46 console.log.resolve
31:51 then console.log B console.log C. Okay.
31:55 The output will be first we'll have C
31:59 then
32:01 >> and this question will clear all your
32:03 doubt regarding event loops synchronous
32:06 micro task all
32:10 >> okay
32:12 B
32:16 >> Mhm.
32:22 Yes, that that one is correct. Okay, one
32:26 more question I have. I just paste it.
32:30 That is correct.
33:03 Okay, you can run and check. No problem.
33:07 It's hello.
33:09 Okay, last question. Uh, I have
33:25 same thing. I think same question.
33:29 >> Okay. It's same question. Okay.
33:33 Return statement. Return statement is
33:36 different.
33:36 >> Yeah, it's not same.
33:39 Oh, wait.
33:41 I got confused.
33:43 [Music]
33:46 This will also print hello.
33:48 >> No, that is undefined.
33:51 You can
33:55 Okay, no problem. Uh then uh we will
33:58 move to the logical one. Uh if you have
34:01 >> this is the concept behind this. This is
34:02 the scope only, right?
34:04 >> Yes.
34:04 >> The scope.
34:06 >> Yeah. Uh the logical question we will
34:09 start now. So uh you have one string for
34:14 example hello. So I want to reverse that
34:18 string. What's the logic you are uh
34:20 thinking and how how you will do it.
34:27 >> We have a string right?
34:29 >> One string.
34:33 Hello. We can
34:38 >> just uh strateg
34:48 [Music]
35:09 Still not
35:11 [Music]
35:28 very powerful.
36:02 It has option right?
36:06 Yeah, you can you can do it. You can put
36:10 in function. I want to know I want
36:12 output in console.
36:15 Okay.
37:03 How do you get a string argument?
37:08 >> String argument is a string.
37:12 Can directly pass the string. We can
37:15 directly pass or we can just uh
37:21 You can just declare it or just pass the
37:24 string. Yes.
37:25 >> Hello here.
37:29 This one reverse. Yes.
37:33 Correct. Okay. Uh if you have a string I
37:38 want to know how uh the occurrence of
37:40 each character. code means uh A is
37:43 coming one time, L is coming two time,
37:47 B is coming zero time like this. How do
37:50 you do?
37:56 >> Occurrence of each characters in a
37:58 string.
38:02 >> I'm not sure on this.
38:04 >> Okay, no problem. Oh okay. If you have
38:06 any function okay no if you have any
38:09 variable
38:11 uh any x variable is equal to uh array
38:16 you can write it first.
38:18 >> Please write down
38:22 any variable you can name name it
38:26 >> okay. Uh array within array one
38:30 comma
38:31 again array again array
38:35 one
38:35 >> okay two comma
38:38 again array
38:41 >> three three
38:43 I want uh the output in flatten flatten
38:46 means 1 2 3 itself single array
38:50 >> how do you think how do you do it
38:55 flat uh nested array
38:57 Uh this is the next
38:58 >> this flat
39:00 >> I want to convert
39:01 >> flat method right
39:03 >> no no don't use flat method otherwise uh
39:05 without flat method how do you do it
39:07 that is very much simple
39:09 >> okay
39:11 uh you have an array
39:16 method
39:18 [Music]
39:24 not sure on the loop I think we can run
39:26 a loop. I was knowing about the flat
39:28 method.
39:29 >> Mhm. No, no, flat is okay. I know. Okay,
39:31 that's fine. Uh just give me one second.
39:35 >> Okay, let's move to the React part. Uh
39:38 what's the difference between class and
39:40 function component? That is simple one.
39:42 I know you don't know about the class
39:44 component. That's why I started this.
39:48 >> So class components are like this ES6.
39:52 This uh these are classes which extend
39:56 this react dot component and this use
39:59 render method to return JSX
40:01 >> whereas uh comp functional components
40:04 are like simple JavaScript functions
40:06 that takes props as an argument and
40:08 return JSX.
40:09 >> Okay. So you know uh class component in
40:12 ES uh ES5 method
40:18 >> you know
40:19 >> not much having knowledge on class
40:21 components.
40:22 >> Okay. ES uh class component in ES5 and
40:25 functional component is why why
40:27 functional component is much more
40:29 popular as of now my question is like
40:32 this.
40:34 >> Yeah. Yeah. So in functional components
40:36 uh the boiler plate code is lesser and
40:39 then we can also manage state and life
40:42 cycle methods using hooks which were
40:45 introduced in React 16. So that is why
40:48 functional components are more popular.
40:51 Okay.
40:52 >> Simple and easy to maintain and
40:54 readable.
40:55 >> Yes, correct. Uh okay, that's correct,
40:57 man. Uh what's the React Fiber? Have you
41:01 heard about this one? React fiber.
41:05 >> Yeah, I have uh heard about it like it u
41:09 what it does it uh when sending the
41:12 updates through to the DOM, it doesn't
41:14 send uh the whole updates, whole set of
41:17 changes. It sends it batch wise. Uh this
41:20 is what I've heard of.
41:22 >> Uh it's a part of uh reconciliation.
41:27 >> Yes, no problem. Uh that is very much uh
41:30 tough. Okay. What are the control and
41:33 uncontrol component?
41:36 Yeah, control components are like it is
41:38 a form input element uh whose value is
41:41 controlled by react state whereas in
41:44 uncontrolled the value it is a form
41:46 input element value can be controlled by
41:49 the DOM directly using uh this userf.
41:53 >> Okay, without a user f how do you do it
41:56 uh in control component?
42:02 Not sure maybe.
42:05 No, I'm not sure how we can achieve
42:07 this.
42:08 >> Okay. No, sure. Let me move to the next
42:10 one.
42:11 >> Uh explain React hooks. Uh like uh any
42:15 two three hooks I need to know. Key.
42:17 Please explain these.
42:19 You can uh stop sharing if you want.
42:22 Yeah.
42:22 >> Yeah. Yeah. That's what I
42:24 >> Yeah. Uh I want uh two three hooks. You
42:27 need to explain. I want to know how you
42:30 relate able to hooks.
42:32 >> Okay. Okay.
42:33 >> Hooks like it were introduced in React
42:36 16.8 I think. So they are they allows
42:40 they allows us to manage state and life
42:42 cycle methods inside functional
42:44 components. Uh some of the hooks which I
42:47 have used are like use state, use
42:49 effect, then we have use context. Uh
42:52 then we have use memo, use call back,
42:55 then we have use ref. These are some few
42:58 hooks. A use state is like we we can
43:01 manage the state using this use state.
43:04 Uh this state value is like uh it
43:07 doesn't uh it persist across rerenders.
43:10 So this is uh used for state management
43:13 or use effect uh for running the side
43:15 effects. Uh suppose like uh data
43:18 fetching and uh DOM manipulation for use
43:22 effect and use context. It is like uh
43:25 use context hook is used to consume the
43:27 context values for global data sharing.
43:30 We can create a context with the help of
43:32 this create context method and then use
43:35 context we can consume this global
43:37 context.
43:39 >> Okay. Uh what's the difference uh
43:41 between use effect and use layout
43:43 effect.
43:46 >> Uh use effect uh is uh like we use for
43:50 data fetching. This is to run side
43:51 effects. Use layout effect is also
43:54 similar to use effect but it I guess it
43:57 runs synchronously and it uh runs the
44:01 side effects after the DOM is uh updated
44:04 but before the browser is painted before
44:08 the UI is there.
44:10 >> Yes, correct. And uh uh how the use uh
44:14 how the use of use memo use call back
44:17 and use rep.
44:20 >> Yeah. uh use memo we can use for
44:23 memorizing computed values like suppose
44:26 we have expensive calculations uh which
44:29 uh do not need to be recalculated
44:31 between rer renders we can memorize this
44:34 and pass in a dependency array this will
44:36 not recalculate this calculations are
44:39 not done again and again between rer
44:41 renders unless the dependency uh value
44:43 is changed uh for use call back we
44:48 actually used for memorizing functions
44:50 these are used to memorize functions so
44:52 that for every rerender we don't need to
44:55 recreate the instance of the function.
44:57 We can use the same instance. So it will
45:00 uh actually um it will not recalculate
45:04 like uh rec create the instance unless
45:07 the dependency anything in the
45:09 dependency array changes. Whereas user
45:12 ref is like it provides us a a mutable
45:15 object which uh will persist across the
45:19 renders.
45:20 Yes,
45:22 >> that is correct.
45:24 >> So,
45:25 what's the difference between context
45:27 API and Redux?
45:31 >> API and Redux. Context API is a like a
45:33 built-in feature. It comes along with
45:35 the React. We don't need to install any
45:38 uh library third party library. We we
45:40 can just import create context and use
45:43 context from React and use it for uh
45:45 state management globally. And then
45:48 context API uh this Redux is a third
45:51 party library uh which we need to
45:53 install it from the uh npm packages and
45:56 we can uh we have a boilerplate code in
45:59 code in redux we use this to set up the
46:02 redux store actions and red users all
46:05 these things.
46:06 >> Okay. So why we use uh redux and why we
46:11 not use context API?
46:13 Mhm. So context API is suitable for
46:17 simple applications. Suppose u in one of
46:21 my project I used context API where we
46:24 had just had to have a theme of our
46:27 application dark mode light mode
46:28 switching between modes. So we needed
46:30 this context across various components.
46:33 So there I have used context API but
46:36 redux is used for more like more complex
46:39 applications larger applications. there
46:41 uh it will be easier for global state
46:43 management if you use the redux.
46:46 >> Yes. Uh what are the react keys? Have
46:50 you used react keys?
46:53 >> Yeah.
46:55 >> Why are they important?
46:58 >> Yeah, they are very important because
47:00 they are uh used for identifying uh they
47:03 are the unique uh ids. First of all, key
47:05 is a unique id. They are used to
47:07 identify which element of the list have
47:09 been changed, added or anything is
47:12 removed. This helps in the efficient uh
47:15 calculation in the diffing during the
47:17 reconciliation process.
47:21 >> Yes.
47:23 Uh what what is code splitting and lazy
47:25 loading rate?
47:28 >> Oh, this two techniques are used for
47:30 performance optimization. Actually code
47:32 splitting we do it uh using this uh uh
47:36 react.lazy component from react. We
47:38 import the heavy component. Suppose a
47:41 data heavy component we have. We import
47:44 this data heavy component in the with
47:46 the help of react lazy and then uh
47:49 render this component with the help of
47:51 with wrapping this suspense method
47:53 actually suspense and then we can
47:55 provide a fallback UI also a simple div
47:59 loading loading div can be provided to.
48:02 >> Yes. Right. And how do you handle uh
48:05 error boundaries in react?
48:08 boundaries.
48:11 Uh this uh if we are using async we can
48:14 have handle it using try catch and dot
48:17 catch method. If it is a dot then dot
48:20 catch method we are using then promises
48:22 we can use catch and then try catches.
48:24 >> No no error boundary is something
48:26 different. Uh in class component we have
48:29 error boundaries uh is applicable in
48:32 class itself. In function we don't have
48:34 any like hooks as of now. So have you
48:39 have you know about error boundaries or
48:41 not? What is it?
48:44 >> Actually error boundary third party
48:46 third party
48:48 >> installer is also available in error
48:49 boundaries that we can install and use
48:51 it in our application. No problem. Then
48:54 uh we have one question uh okay react
48:58 question I have. I want to know the
49:00 output of that one.
49:04 You can you can check uh if you want you
49:07 can share your screen
49:11 >> share my screen.
49:12 >> Mhm. Just share.
49:17 What's the output?
49:18 >> We have a simple component
49:21 registrate
49:26 set count
49:29 here.
49:34 So every time it rerenders it increases
49:36 the count value and displays it. Okay.
49:39 For first time it will just uh uh print
49:43 uh like this one um one as as one
49:49 >> actually it's infinite uh uh rendering
49:54 uh because of there is state update or
49:56 every render
49:59 >> that is
49:59 >> yeah yeah we don't have any condition
50:01 every rerender it will keep on
50:03 increasing the count
50:06 >> okay one more question to to
50:25 So once the app is loaded, it will just
50:29 uh uh set this uh count value to 10 and
50:33 display it as 10. So between renders the
50:36 value stays the same because we have
50:38 empty dependency array.
50:41 >> Are you sure it will tell rerender it's
50:44 render 10?
50:48 >> Yeah yeah
50:48 >> what about zero
50:52 use state react dot use state zero.
50:58 Yeah, that is the default value. That is
51:01 the initial value. Once uh we are
51:03 updating it will just uh
51:07 within use effect I will put dependency
51:10 zero
51:10 >> within use effect. Sorry
51:13 >> dependency is blank.
51:15 So it's it's which state uh that is like
51:19 in component life cycle which state they
51:22 are following here.
51:25 So the component uh did update
51:30 >> mounting. No.
51:33 >> Yeah. When the component this uh app is
51:36 loaded.
51:37 >> So before it is loaded it uh this
51:39 component uh will component did mount is
51:43 uh this this is
51:46 uh actually initially it solves zero and
51:49 then it's mounted to 10. The both the
51:52 value is displayed.
51:54 Okay.
51:55 >> Okay. No problem. Uh I have one more
51:58 last question. Uh how do you uh optimize
52:04 your code if you have thousand of API
52:07 data?
52:09 So how do you handle it
52:12 simply in front end?
52:15 In front end we can uh actually do this
52:18 uh pagination
52:20 uh and also we can implement uh scroll
52:23 to load this infinite scrolling and also
52:26 we can use make use of this technique
52:28 called virtualization we have libraries
52:32 react virtualization or react window we
52:34 can make use of these techniques and
52:37 handle this large amount of data.
52:39 >> Yes correct. Okay, the interview is
52:42 done. Now, uh I will give you some
52:44 feedback. Uh uh first of all, you need
52:48 to work on your réumé itself. Rumé, you
52:50 need to just improve that réumé word. I
52:53 will share you after this call, I will
52:55 share you the rumé link where you can
52:57 build your resume. And second uh output
53:01 is like you need to improve your uh
53:04 logical skill. Logical skill uh
53:07 definitely you need to work. uh you just
53:10 uh uh you just target it to firstly
53:14 create account to le code le code create
53:16 account then uh revise two three
53:18 question daily then only your logical
53:21 skill is uh
53:22 >> uh improve better
53:25 >> uh after one month it will take one
53:26 month to improve the logical
53:28 >> yeah definitely
53:29 >> yeah that is the second thing
53:31 >> just start like working with the
53:35 organization right like not getting much
53:37 time to practice these So
53:39 >> it will not take more than 10 to 15
53:42 minute. Just create just create a lead
53:45 code account and then start with easy to
53:48 hard that motive you can
53:51 >> okay thing is there and just the
53:54 theoretical you are okay in react
53:56 theoretical uh HTML HTML CSS your is
53:59 very good according to me uh we don't
54:03 you don't have any issue HTML CSS just
54:06 brush up JavaScript logical thing and
54:09 react more deeply goes to the react
54:12 Uh you mean uh just uh write it out.
54:15 React 19 version is there. Learn React
54:18 19 version if it is uh you have time. So
54:20 you can start exploring my React 19
54:23 series. I have already uploaded in re
54:26 YouTube and freely available and I have
54:28 also create uh Redux uh uh series also
54:32 in my YouTube channel. So that will
54:34 create a help to you very much otherwise
54:38 uh you are okay according to as you have
54:40 three year experience within three year
54:42 experience just focused more on uh our
54:45 GitHub repository portfolio also you
54:48 know in future portfolio is very much
54:52 needed if if someone have good portfolio
54:55 then only they will get a job in future
54:59 >> yeah that you need to work itself that's
55:01 uh that's why I'm asking Okay. Everyone
55:04 need to be check uh everyone hire
55:07 >> perfect person in company.
55:10 >> That's
55:12 okay. Otherwise everything looks good uh
55:15 uh for me. Okay. Okay. Alam thanks.
55:19 Thank you for joining.
55:21 >> Yeah. Yeah. Very thank you for this like
55:23 having this session with me.
